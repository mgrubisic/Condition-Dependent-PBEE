Weyers Publication: Materials Journal Volume: 95 Issue: 6 Pages: 675-680 Keywords: chloride-induced corrosion; concrete; corrosion cracking model; time-to-cracking Date: November 1, 1998 Abstract: The time to cracking, from corrosion initiation to cracking of the reinforcing steel cover concrete, is one of the critical time periods for modeling the time to repair, rehabilitate and replace reinforced concrete structures in corrosive environments. The time-to-corrosion cracking was experimentally determined from simulated bridge deck slabs. The experimental design considered corrosion rate, concrete cover depth, reinforcing steel bar spacing and size. Three, of the 14 slab series, cracked during the 5 year study. Metal loss was determined for the cracked specimens which had cover depths of 1, 2, and 3 in. (25, 51, and 76 mm). A time-to-corrosion cracking model was developed considering the critical amount of corrosion products which consists of the amount of corrosion products needed to fill the interconnected void space around the reinforcing bar plus the amount of corrosion products needed to generate sufficient tensile stresses to crack the cover concrete. The experimentally observed time to cracking is in good agreement with the model predicted time to cracking.},

abstract = {Corrosion damage is one of the main problems affecting the durability of concrete structures. Several corroded reinforced concrete (RC) railway bridges are located in regions of high seismic risk. Corroded bridge piers are often subjected to dynamic axial loads, such as the vertical pounding that occurs during earthquakes or due to railway trains. Repeated axial loading was used to simulate this vertical pounding effect. Therefore, the seismic performance of corroded RC structures under repeated axial and horizontal cyclic loading is an urgent issue. To investigate the influences of steel corrosion and repeated axial loading on the seismic performance of a column pier, eight RC column speci-mens were experimentally investigated. The results indicated that corrosion significantly influences the yield strength and load bearing capacity of a column. The load bearing capacities of the corroded specimens decreased by 18.27{\%} compared with noncorroded specimens when the longitudinal loss of steel mass was 7.16{\%}. Repeated axial loading did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the cor-roded RC piers. Cyclic tests were performed to validate a finite-element model that was used to assess the effects of corrosion level on the seis-mic performance of columns. The level of steel corrosion ranged from 0 to 28{\%}. According to the finite-element analysis, the yield strength (35{\%}) and ultimate displacement (34{\%}) decreased with increasing corrosion.},

@article{Choe2008,
abstract = {In this paper, probabilistic drift and shear force capacity models are developed for corroding reinforced concrete (RC) columns. The developments represent a merger between a probabilistic model for chloride-induced corrosion, a time-dependent corrosion rate, and previously developed probabilistic models for drift and shear force capacity of pristine (undamaged) RC columns. Fragility estimates are obtained for an example corroding column by applying the developed models at given shear and drift demands. Model uncertainties in both the capacity and corrosion models are considered in the fragility estimation, in addition to uncertainties in environmental conditions, material properties, and structural geometry. Sensitivity analyses of the corroding RC column are carried out to identify the parameters to which the reliability of the example column is most sensitive. The developed models consider different combinations of chloride exposure condition, environmental oxygen availability, water-to-cement ratios, and curing conditions. They are applicable to both existing and new RC columns and may be employed for the prediction of service-life and life-cycle cost analysis of RC structures.},

abstract = {A structural deterioration reliability (probabilistic) model has been used herein to calculate probabilities of structural failure. New reinforced concrete corrosion initiation, corrosion rate and time-variant load models are proposed. Three durability design specifications are considered in a lifetime reliability analysis of a RC slab bridge. Time-variant increases in loads are considered also. It was found that the application of de-icing salts causes significant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural safety for poor durability design specifications. A reduced cover or increased water-cement ratio increases failure probabilities. When compared to the case of “no deterioration”, it was observed also that the probability of failure only marginally increased for good durability design specifications. The approaches described herein are relevant to other physical infrastructure also.},

abstract = {A reasonable understanding of the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel is required to accurately estimate the performance of reinforced concrete members subjected to cyclic deformations beyond the elastic range such as those expected from large earthquakes. Although the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel has been extensively studied, very little is known about the effects that factors such as the bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging have on the cyclic behavior. The effects of strain aging on the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel can be very relevant when considering postearthquake retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures. A series of cyclic uniaxial tests were conducted at the University of Canterbury on the two commercially available grades of New Zealand reinforcing steel, where the effects of cyclic loading, bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging on the stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel were investigated. The emphasis of the tests was to observe the material behavior, and hence buckling was restricted. The present paper describes the test setup and discusses the results of the investigation.},

abstract = {This paper presents the formulation of a time-dependent seismic fragility format for bridges, as well as new insights into the potential effects of aging and deterioration on seismic vulnerability traditionally neglected in fragility modeling, including joint impacts of multiple component deterioration not investigated to date. The study evaluates the impact of lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components' degradation and their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the representative bridge geometry, with a 32{\%} shift in the median value of complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge's life.},

@article{Du2005,
abstract = {This paper presents an experimental investigation into the residual capacity of corroded reinforcing bars. By performing both accelerated and simulated corrosion tests on bare bars and on bars embedded in concrete, the mechanism of the reduction of the capacity of corroded reinforcement was investigated. The influence of type and diameter of reinforcement on its residual capacity is discussed. The experimental results show that, due to local attack penetration, the residual cross-section of a corroded bar is no longer round and varies considerably along its circumference and its length. Although the force-extension curves of corroded bars are similar to those of non­corroded bars for up to 16{\%} corrosion, their residual yield and ultimate forces decrease more rapidly than their average cross-sectional area and, therefore, their residual strength decreases significantly. Even though the residual capacity of corroded small diameter and/or plain bars reduces more than that of large diameter or ribbed ones, differences are not significant and can be neglected. Finally, a simple equation is proposed to predict the residual capacity of corroded reinforcing bars in practice.},
